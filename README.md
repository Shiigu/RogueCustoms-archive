This is an archive repository of the Rogue Customs roguelike game. Running in SadConsole and with a .NET Core server, this had the ability to be both played offline and online.

It went until beta version 1.7.0, where the serverside component got removed and the game got ported to Godot 4.

Current version can be found here: https://github.com/Shiigu/RogueCustoms
